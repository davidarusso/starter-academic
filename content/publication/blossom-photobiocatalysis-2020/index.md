abstract: Photobiocatalysis holds great promise towards the development of sustainable
  and environmentally friendly processes, harnessing light to drive biocatalytic reactions.
  However, photobiocatalysis at the interface of insoluble substrates, such as cellulose
  has not been studied in much detail. In this context, the catalytic enhancement
  of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) by light is of great interest to
  the biorefinery field due to their capacity to oxidatively cleave such recalcitrant
  polysaccharides which can facilitate the degradation of lignocellulose. It has previously
  been reported that light-driven LPMO-reactions have a huge catalytic potential but
  effective continuous illumination in reactors may be challenging. Therefore, we
  investigated the impact of intermittent illumination. We show that illumination
  intervals as short as 1 s/min enables LPMO-catalysis on phosphoric acid swollen
  cellulose (PASC) to the same level as continuous illumination. Additionally, time-resolved
  measurements indicate that reductant depletion, and not enzyme inactivation, limits
  light-driven LPMO reactions. This study shows that a 60-fold reduction in illumination
  time enhances LPMO-catalysis while protecting reaction elements, e.g. the reductant.
  Most importantly, the significant enhancement of LPMO-catalysis with minimal and
  intermittent illumination is promising towards an application of photobiocatalytic
  depolymerization of lignocellulose where shading and light-scattering minimize light
  availability and continuity.
