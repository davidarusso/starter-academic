abstract: '**Background**
Cyanobacteria have the potential to become next-generation cell factories due to their ability to use CO2, light and inorganic nutrients to produce a range of biomolecules of commercial interest. Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973, in particular, is a fast-growing, genetically tractable, cyanobacterium that has garnered attention as a potential biotechnological chassis. To establish this unique strain as a host for heterologous protein production, we aimed to demonstrate expression and secretion of the industrially relevant *Tf*AA10A, a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from the Gram-positive bacterium Thermobifida fusca.
**Results**
Two variations of *Tf*AA10A were successfully expressed in *S. elongatus* UTEX 2973: One containing the native N-terminal, Sec-targeted, signal peptide and a second with a Tat-targeted signal peptide from the *Escherichia coli* trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA). Although the TorA signal peptide correctly targeted the protein to the plasma membrane, the majority of the TorA-*Tf*AA10A was found unprocessed in the plasma membrane with a small fraction of the mature protein ultimately translocated to the periplasm. The native Sec signal peptide allowed for efficient secretion of *Tf*AA10A into the medium with virtually no protein being found in the cytosol, plasma membrane or periplasm. *Tf*AA10A was demonstrated to be correctly cleaved and active on the model substrate phosphoric acid swollen cellulose. Additionally, expression and secretion only had a minor impact on cell growth. The secretion yield was estimated at 779 ± 40 µg L<sup>-1</sup> based on densitometric analysis. To our knowledge, this is the highest secretion yield ever registered in cyanobacteria.
**Conclusions**
We have shown for the first time high-titer expression and secretion of an industrially relevant and catalytically active enzyme in *S. elongatus* UTEX 2973. This proof-of-concept study will be valuable for the development of novel and sustainable applications in the fields of bioremediation and biocatalysis.'
