abstract: Cyanobacteria have the potential to become next-generation cell factories
  due to their ability to use CO2, light and inorganic nutrients to produce a range
  of biomolecules of commercial interest. Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973, in particular,
  is a fast-growing, genetically tractable, cyanobacterium that has garnered attention
  as a potential biotechnological chassis. To establish this unique strain as a host
  for heterologous protein production, we aimed to demonstrate expression and secretion
  of the industrially relevant TfAA10A, a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from
  the Gram-positive bacterium Thermobifida fusca.
