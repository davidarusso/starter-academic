abstract: Eutrophication can lead to an uncontrollable increase in algal biomass,
  which has repercussions for the entire microbial and pelagic community. Studies
  have shown how nutrient enrichment affects microbial species succession, however
  details regarding the impact on community functionality are rare. Here, we applied
  a metaproteomic approach to investigate the functional changes to algal and bacterial
  communities, over time, in oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions, in freshwater
  microcosms. Samples were taken early during algal and cyanobacterial dominance and
  later under bacterial dominance. 1048 proteins, from the two treatments and two
  timepoints, were identified and quantified by their exponentially modified protein
  abundance index. In oligotrophic conditions, Bacteroidetes express extracellular
  hydrolases and Ton-B dependent receptors to degrade and transport high molecular
  weight compounds captured while attached to the phycosphere. Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria
  were found to capture different substrates from algal exudate (carbohydrates and
  amino acids, respectively) suggesting resource partitioning to avoid direct competition.
  In eutrophic conditions, environmental adaptation proteins from cyanobacteria suggested
  better resilience compared to algae in a low carbon nutrient enriched environment.
  This study provides insight into differences in functional microbial processes between
  oligo- and eutrophic conditions at different timepoints and highlights how primary
  producers control bacterial resources in freshwater environments.
