abstract: 'Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-containing enzymes which promote the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides like cellulose or chitin. Here, we have investigated the thermostability of an LPMO from *Thermoascus aurantiacus* (*Ta*LPMO9A). *Ta*LPMO9A was found to retain most of its initial activity after incubating at 100 °C while its apparent melting temperature (Tm) is 69 °C at neutral pH. Interestingly, our studies show that holo*Ta*LPMO9A, apo*Ta*LPMO9A and deglycosylated *Ta*LPMO9A can fold back to their original conformation upon lowering the temperature. In the presence of β-mercaptoethanol the protein does not refold. Activity of *Ta*LPMO9A and refolded *Ta*LPMO9A was studied by an Amplex® Red assay as well as by *Ta*LPMO9A catalysed oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). These studies confirm the functional regain of *Ta*LPMO9A activity upon going through one cycle of unfolding and refolding. The thermal unfolding and refolding of *Ta*LPMO9A was measured spectroscopically. Utilizing the two-state model, detailed thermodynamic parameters were obtained for holo*Ta*LPMO. Furthermore, we have investigated the kinetics of *Ta*LPMO9A unfolding and refolding. Our results have implications in understanding LPMO stability, which is crucial for the efficient application of LPMOs as biocatalysts during biomass degradation.'
