abstract: The unicellular green alga Lobomonas rostrata requires an external supply
  of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) for growth, which it can obtain in stable laboratory
  cultures from the soil bacterium Mesorhizobium loti in exchange for photosynthate.
  We investigated changes in protein expression in the alga that allow it to engage
  in this mutualism. We used quantitative isobaric tagging (iTRAQ) proteomics to determine
  the L. rostrata proteome grown axenically with B12 supplementation or in coculture
  with M. loti. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (PXD005046). Using the related
  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a reference genome, 588 algal proteins could be identified.
  Enzymes of amino acid biosynthesis were higher in coculture than in axenic culture,
  and this was reflected in increased amounts of total cellular protein and several
  free amino acids. A number of heat shock proteins were also elevated. Conversely,
  photosynthetic proteins and those of chloroplast protein synthesis were significantly
  lower in L. rostrata cells in coculture. These observations were confirmed by measurement
  of electron transfer rates in cells grown under the two conditions. The results
  indicate that, despite the stability of the mutualism, L. rostrata experiences stress
  in coculture with M. loti, and must adjust its metabolism accordingly.
