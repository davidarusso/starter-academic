abstract: $\textbf{Background}$ Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are indispensable
  redox enzymes used in industry for the saccharification of plant biomass. LPMO-driven
  cellulose oxidation can be enhanced considerably through photobiocatalysis using
  chlorophyll derivatives and light. Water soluble chlorophyll binding proteins (WSCPs)
  make it is possible to stabilize and solubilize chlorophyll in aqueous solution,
  allowing for in vitro studies on photostability and ROS production. Here we aim
  to apply WSCP–Chl a as a photosensitizing complex for photobiocatalysis with the
  LPMO, TtAA9. $\textbf{Results}$ We have in this study demonstrated how WSCP reconstituted
  with chlorophyll a (WSCP–Chl a) can create a stable photosensitizing complex which
  produces controlled amounts of ­H2O2 in the presence of ascorbic acid and light.
  WSCP–Chl a is highly reactive and allows for tightly controlled formation of ­H2O2
  by regulating light intensity. TtAA9 together with WSCP–Chl a shows increased cellulose
  oxidation under low light conditions, and the WSCP–Chl a complex remains stable
  after 24 h of light exposure. Additionally, the WSCP–Chl a complex demonstrates
  stability over a range of temperatures and pH conditions relevant for enzyme activity
  in industrial settings. $\textbf{Conclusion}$ With WSCP–Chl a as the photosensitizer, the
  need to replenish Chl is greatly reduced, enhancing the catalytic lifetime of light-driven
  LPMOs and increasing the efficiency of cellulose depolymerization. WSCP–Chl a allows
  for stable photobiocatalysis providing a sustainable solution for biomass processing.
