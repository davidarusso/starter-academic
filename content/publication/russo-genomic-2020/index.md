abstract: 'Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria with a versatile
  metabolism that is highly dependent on effective protein targeting. Protein sorting
  in diderm bacteria is not trivial and, in cyanobacteria, even less so due to the
  presence of a complex membrane system: the outer membrane, the plasma membrane and
  the thylakoid membrane. In cyanobacteria, protein import into the thylakoids is
  essential for photosynthesis, export to the periplasm fulfills a multifunctional
  role in maintaining cell homeostasis, and secretion mediates motility, DNA uptake
  and environmental interactions. Intriguingly, only one set of genes for the general
  secretory and the twin-arginine translocation pathways seem to be present. However,
  these systems have to operate in both plasma and thylakoid membranes. This raises
  the question of how substrates are recognized and targeted to their correct, final
  destination. Additional complexities arise when a protein has to be secreted across
  the outer membrane, where very little is known regarding the mechanisms involved.
  Given their ecological importance and biotechnological interest, a better understanding
  of protein targeting in cyanobacteria is of great value. This review will provide
  insights into the known knowns of protein targeting, propose hypotheses based on
  available genomic sequences and discuss future directions.'
