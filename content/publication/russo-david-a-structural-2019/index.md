abstract: Anthropogenic eutrophication has caused widespread environmental problems
  in freshwater lakes, reducing biodiversity and disrupting the classic pelagic food
  chain. Increasing our understanding of the exact role of nutrients and physicochemical
  variables on microbial dynamics, and subsequent microalgal and cyanobacterial blooms,
  has involved numerous studies ranging from replicate microcosm-based studies through
  to temporal studies of real lake data. In a previous experimental microcosm study,
  we utilised metaproteomics to investigate the functional changes of a microalgal-bacterial
  community under oligotrophic and eutrophic nutrient levels. Here, we analyse the
  time series data from this experiment with a combination of typically used univariate
  analyses and a more modern multivariate approach, structural equation modelling.
  Our aim was to test, using these modern methods, whether physicochemical variables
  and nutrient dynamics acted additively, synergistically, or antagonistically on
  the speciﬁc biotic community used in the microcosms. We found that nutrients (nitrogen
  and phosphorus) and temperature acted additively on the interactions between the
  microalgae and bacteria present, with the temperature eﬀects elevated in the eutrophic
  conditions we applied. The data suggests that there may be no synergistic interaction
  between nutrients and temperature in the tested microcosms. Our approach demonstrates
  how the application of multivariate methods to existing datasets, in our case from
  nutrient-enriched freshwater microcosms, enables new information to be extracted,
  enhancing interpretations as well as allowing more reliable comparisons to similar
  published studies.
