abstract: A laboratory based microflotation rig termed efficient FLOtation of Algae
  Technology (eFLOAT) was used to optimise parameters for harvesting microalgal biomass
  from eutrophic water systems. This was performed for the dual objectives of remediation
  (nutrient removal) and resource recovery. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
  chitosan was more efficient than alum for flocculation of biomass and the presence
  of bacteria could play a positive role and reduce flocculant application rates under
  the natural conditions tested. Maximum biomass removal from a hyper-eutrophic water
  retention pond sample was achieved with 5 mg·L−1 chitosan (90% Chlorophyll a removal).
  Harvesting at maximum rates showed that after 10 days, the bacterial diversity is
  significantly increased with reduced cyanobacteria, indicating improved ecosystem
  functioning. The resource potential within the biomass was characterized by 9.02
  μg phosphate, 0.36 mg protein, and 103.7 μg lipid per mg of biomass. Fatty acid
  methyl ester composition was comparable to pure cultures of microalgae, dominated
  by C16 and C18 chain lengths with saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. Finally, the laboratory data was translated into a full-size and modular
  eFLOAT system, with estimated costs as a novel eco-technology for efficient algal
  bloom harvesting.
