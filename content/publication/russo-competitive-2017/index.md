abstract: 'Key microalgal species are currently being exploited as biomanufacturing
  platforms using mass cultivation systems. The opportunities to enhance productivity
  levels or produce non-native compounds are increasing as genetic manipulation and
  metabolic engineering tools are rapidly advancing. Regardless of the end product,
  there are both environmental and industrial risks associated to open pond cultivation
  of mutant microalgal strains. A mutant escape could be detrimental to local biodiversity
  and increase the risk of algal blooms. Similarly, if the cultivation pond is invaded
  by a wild-type (WT) microalgae or the mutant reverts to WT phenotypes, productivity
  could be impacted. To investigate these potential risks, a response surface methodology
  was applied to determine the competitive outcome of two *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*
  strains, a WT (CC-124) and a high-lipid accumulating mutant (CC-4333), grown in
  mixotrophic conditions, with differing levels of nitrogen and initial WT to mutant
  ratios. Results of the growth experiments show that mutant cells have double the
  exponential growth rate of the WT in monoculture. However, due to a slower transition
  from lag phase to exponential phase, mutant cells are outcompeted by the WT in every
  co-culture treatment. This suggests that, under the conditions tested, outdoor cultivation
  of the *C. reinhardtii* cell wall-deficient mutant strains does not carry a significant
  environmental risk to its WT in an escape scenario. Furthermore, lipid results show
  the mutant strain accumulates over 200% more TAGs per cell, at 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
  compared to the WT, therefore, the fragility of the mutant strain could impact on
  overall industrial productivity.'
